# NDIIOPlugin-UE5
Modified NDIIOPlugin for UE5 (5.0.2)

WORK IN PROGRESS

## Introduction

Needed for a project I am working on an updated version of the NDIIOPlugin for UE5 (5.0.2). In this plugin receiving NDI in UE5 works. Sending is a work in progress, but will not yield the quality most people are looking for. 

It is not recommended to use this version of the plugin for shipping purposes and no guarentee is given that it works. Use on your own risk and if you are relient on NDI best is to wait for a complete updated version from NewTek. 

## Usage
The plugin works like normal for receiving NDI.
